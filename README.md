<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is made simpler from the original project of [JS Quiz by James Qquick](https://github.com/jamesqquick/Build-A-Quiz-App-With-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript) in order to reduce the complicacy level into a learnable phase. I made also a more complicated project of this one, [click here]().
  
### Modification

Noticeable modification made is on the separation of codes; codes are divided into different files based on its categories: data, handler, logic, listener, etc. The rest of the codes follow the original codes, with a minimum modifaction.

- [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com)
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
